# Personal Podcast Assistant
With this easy to use script, you can consolidate all your podcasts news in just one email channel. Insted of subscribe to multiple email feeds, you can just add the feed URL to the script and the assistant will enter weekly on those feeds and get the news to your email. This script will also install all the required dependencies, so the only this you need to do is to add your email credentials to the script before running it locally on your computer. 

Enjoy it and let me know if there is something in which I can help you!
